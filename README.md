# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Hand me your deliverables and I will put them online, secure them and make them resiliently available.

Some call me devops engineer, some call me platform engineer, some call me cloud engineer.
Two little boys even call me "nerdy dad ðŸ¤“". But I like to refer to myself as Tony Stark.

Things you should know.. I :
- installed linux on a toaster.
- use portscanning as a pastime.
- think programming is puzzling.
- think puzzling is fun.
- am lead by my curiosity.
- value "logically correct" reasoning - striving to avoid biases and testing assumptions.
- have an automated plant watering system which calls me by my name every time my plants need water. Which lead me to replacing all my plants with cacti.
- dream about exploring deep space.
- think any non-holistic cyclical economic and social system on spaceship earth is madness.
- am not opposed to capitalism, but we should investigate alternatives before Jeff Bezos downloads himself into an evil robot and takes over the world.
- have some "computer skills"; from writing my own firmware in C to setting up my own auto-scaling amazon web services / google cloud clone. You name it, I'm too lazy to do it. But I could.
- run Linux, FreeBSD, Nix, Arch, Alpine and Macos, but am actually able to proficiently use Microsoft Windows.
- was actually born 500 years into the future. No idea how I got here.
- made this github under a pseudonym because I believe privacy is a necessity in an open society. While I know this does not provide me with anonimity, I choose not to tie my online persona directly to my real person whenever I can.
