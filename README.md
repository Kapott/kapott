# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a freelance software developer, security researcher & nerdy dad ðŸ¤“. This github was created under a pseudonym because I believe privacy is a necessity in an open society. While this does not provide me with anonimity, I choose not to tie my online persona directly to my real person whenever I can.

Feel free to browse the repositories, engage in healthy discourse on my [website](//kapott.io) or add me on [twitter](//twitter.com/kapott_) for retweets of certain units of culture and rants about design, security, privacy and Elon Musk's rightful rule over Mars as Elon Elon the first.

Live long and prosper,

kapott_
